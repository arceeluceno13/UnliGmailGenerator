Unlimited Gmail Generator with Randomized Suffixes.

This Java program generates unlimited Gmail addresses by allowing randomized suffixes. It uses a simple algorithm to create unique email addresses by appending random strings to a base email prefix.

How it Works
The program takes a base email prefix (e.g., "example.email") and generates unlimited Gmail addresses with randomized suffixes in the format ".email+randomsuffix@gmail.com". This feature utilizes the Gmail aliasing feature where "+randomsuffix" can be added to the email prefix without affecting email delivery, making it easier to manage and filter incoming emails.
